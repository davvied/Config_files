    # Switch between windows
    # Move windows between left/right columns or move up/down in current stack.
    # Moving out of range in Columns layout will create new column.
    # Grow windows. If current window is on the edge of screen and direction
    # will be to screen edge - window would shrink.
    # Toggle between split and unsplit sides of stack.
    # Split = all windows displayed
    # Unsplit = 1 window displayed, like Max layout, but still with
    # multiple stack panes
    # Toggle between different layouts as defined below
